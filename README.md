# Spotify-Playlist-to-a-text-file
This playlist turns a spotify playlist from an account into a text file.

This was supposed to go further and add it to my apple music account but I don't feel like paying $100 to use the Apple Music API. 

I just threw this together in a day as I was just looking for a quick solution to my problem of moving my spotify playlists to my new apple music account through Verizon.
